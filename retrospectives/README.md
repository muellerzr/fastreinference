# Retrospectives

## What are they?

These are short summaries of ideas that were iterated over and then reverted back to.
They are extremely similar to AGILE Sprint retrospectives, except the format is on an idea-by-idea basis.

## General Format

All retrospectives should have the following format:

- Title: `classOrFunctionName.ipynb`
- Sections:
  - What was the goal and intended behavior?
  - Source code
  - Behaviors in action
    - Failed version
    - Version I went with
  - Why did this version not make it in
